# Projects
### Game Development Competition:
- Led a team in developing a video game for a competition in October 2022. It was a three day 
effort, two of us on the team. The [final product](https://github.com/joshuardecker/darkest-harvest) was an endless wave based survival game 
for windows. The comments given by the judges were that the game was creative and had 
high potential for future development.
### Building an 8bit Computer From Scratch:
- Been slowly working on an 8bit computer built with breadboards, wires, and very simple chips.
I started off by building the clock the computer runs on, and am now working on building the 
registers and memory. Starting from scratch like this really forces you to learn everything 
about everything.
### Open Source Game:
- I truly believe learning to make video games is a great way for many kids, teens, and adults
to get their foot in the door of coding. So I am actively working on a more than hobbyist 
open source video game that will come with documentation on how everything is laid out and 
works, to hopefully help anyone in their journey to build a game for themselves. You can find
a link [here](https://github.com/joshuardecker/eternal-harvest).
